	- The overview of NVSB. The training process consists of 2 stages, and the second stage shares the same
	  pipeline with the inference stage. “VAE Enc” means the encoder of CVAE; “VAE Dec” means the decoder of
	  CVAE; “Mel” means the mel-spectrogram; “z” means the latent variable of the vocal tone; the “a”/“p” subscript
	  means the amateur/professional version.
