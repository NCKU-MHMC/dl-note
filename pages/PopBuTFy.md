- Since there is no publicly available highquality, unaccompanied and parallel singing dataset for the SVB task, we collect and annotate a dataset containing both Chinese Mandarin and English pop songs: PopBuTFy. To collect PopBuTFy for SVB, the qualified singers majoring in vocal music are asked to sing a song twice, using the amateur vocal tone for one time and the professional vocal tone for another. Note that some of the amateur recordings are sung off-key by one or more semi-tones for the pitch correction sub-task. The parallel setting could make sure that the personal vocal timbre will keep still during the beautifying process.
- In all, PopBuTFy consists of 99 Chinese pop songs (∼10.4 hours in total) from 12 singers and 443 English pop songs (∼40.4 hours in total) from 22 singers. All the audio files are recorded in a professional recording studio by qualified singers, male and female. Every song is sampled at 22050 Hz with 16-bit quantization. We randomly choose 274 pieces in Chinese and 617 pieces in English for validation and test. For subjective evaluations, we choose 60 samples in the test set from different singers, half in Chinese and English. All testing samples are included for objective evaluations.
